## Performance-oriented Less Greedy Decision Trees

**Disclaimer: This is a work In Progress**

Implementation of Less Greedy Decision Tree using rust and a python wrapper.

An LGDTPredictor class is built around the Rust implementation and is compatible with Scikit-learn


### Running the code:
- Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and ensure that cargo is available in the **PATH**
- Download the repository and open a terminal inside it
- With **pip** just run ```pip install .``` to install the package
- You can see an example of how to use it in the [example](experiments/example.py).
- To run the main experiments you need another packages installed using :
  - ```pip install .[pydl85dep]```
  - ```pip install .[experiments]```

- Open a terminal in the experiments folder and run the file you want.
